# I have no fixed or registered address

If you are in England, Scotland or Wales, you can register online at [gov.uk/register-to-vote][0]. If you are in Northern Ireland, visit our [Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form][1].

If you do not have a permanent address, you can register at an address where you spend a substantial part of your time or have some connection. This could be a previously permanent address, shelter or similar place.

You can register by filling in a form called a **'Declaration of local connection'**. You can download a [Register to vote form (no fixed address) from gov.uk][2].
