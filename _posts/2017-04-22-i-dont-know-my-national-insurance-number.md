# I don't know my "National Insurance Number"

You can still fill in the [registration form][0], but it's best if you can find your number.

[Click here ][1]for help **finding **your number.

### Here's what the Government says:

You can:

* look for your National Insurance number on payslips or official letters about tax, pensions or benefits
* [I need help finding my National Insurance number][2]

If you can't provide a National Insurance number you will need to explain why. You'll also need to send copies of identity documents through the post. This could delay your name getting on the electoral register.
