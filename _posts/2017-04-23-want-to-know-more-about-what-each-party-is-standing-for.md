# Want to know more about what each party is standing for?

Around a general election each party brings out a document called a manifesto. 

A manifesto spells out what the party hopes to achieve when elected. The manifesto will give voters a general idea of what the party stands for, even though some of the policies can be a bit far-fecthed and wil never be put into practice.

As this election was set up in a SNAP the manifestos have not been written, but the parties have put forward some pledges:
