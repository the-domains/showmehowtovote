# Not free on the 8th June? Postal vote is easy.

A postal vote is the same as a vote done on election day. You just need to register, then post it in advance.

Here's how:

<article style=""><h1>Apply for a postal vote - GOV.UK</h1><p>Anyone can apply to vote by post. You don't need to give a reason.</p></article>

If you know someone who can't be there - like Gran or your cousin Mildred - let them know too.
